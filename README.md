Problem Statement: 
<br>
The City Central Library has decided to digitize its operations to make book management, membership services, and data tracking more efficient. They need a Java-based application to handle book records, member details, and transactions using File Handling and the Java Collections Framework. 
The system must be capable of: 
•	Adding new books and members. 
•	Issuing and returning books. 
•	Storing and retrieving data from files for persistence. 
•	Using collections to efficiently search, sort, and manage records. 
<br>
Project Objectives: 
<br>
•	Apply File Handling concepts to store and retrieve library data from text and binary files. 
•	Implement Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue) to manage records dynamically. 
•	Use Comparable and Comparator for sorting books and members by different criteria. 
•	Practice Buffered I/O, Character Streams, and Byte Streams for efficient file operations. 
•	Apply Generics in collections for type-safe data handling
